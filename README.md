# Joke App

The Joke App is a Flutter-based mobile application that fetches and displays programming and Christmas-themed jokes from the JokeAPI. It features a modern, responsive UI with animated cards and a clean design. Users can tap a button to fetch new jokes, which are displayed in an easy-to-read format with support for both single-line and two-part jokes. The app uses Material Design 3 principles and handles both success and error states gracefully.
